# Getting Started

angular is a js framework designed to create single-page html and change the DOM at runtime

app-root

## App Start-up

app.component.ts

script files and imported into index.html, main.ts prompts it to gather app modules

## Components
whole application is composed from a couple of components

app/root component

### AppComponent
A component is a TS Class

use a TS class decorattor with '@'

*Angular uses components to build webpages and uses modules to bundle/package those components together*

### in Terminal
ng generate component
ng g c 

Can use component templates in any other component


## Modules

## Templates
inline templates or URL depending on amount of HTML or CSS

## Selectors
like how you select css elements
also can select by class (but not id or pseudoselectors)

## Databinding
communication between TS code (business logic) --> Template (html) that the user sees
Output data: (string interpolation, property binding) -->
<-- React to (User) events: event binding

{{ 'string' }} - string interpolation

dynamically binding? [property]

string interpolation vs property binding

two-way databinding: both directions and reacting to events/changes

## Directives are instructions in the DOM
structural directives


great lessons, so much making more sense
