# Angular

### What is Angular?
A JavaScript Framework which allows you to create reactive Single-Page-Applications(SPAs)

UX - User Experience

reactive wtihout needing to access the server (or have it load in the background)

javascript is changing the DOM in realtime

### Different Versions of Angular

Angular JS (Angular 1) --> Angular 2 (2016) -->Angular 4 (where'd 3 go???)...basically a new version every 6 months

Very backwards compatible, hasn't changed much since angular 2

 Hey I know this!

  Angular is meant to be used with TypeScript (not JS)
