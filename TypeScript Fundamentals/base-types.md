#Base Types and Primitives

number, string, boolean-just like javascript


"let age: number;"  The type is lower case starting characters

"age = 12.1;"  works with floating points
"age = '12';"  Error because variable was set as number not a string

"let userName: string;
userName = 'Max';"

"let isInstructor: boolean;
 isInstructor = true;"

 Pretty much as you would expect
